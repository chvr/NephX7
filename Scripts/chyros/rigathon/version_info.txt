Version 1.0.302
===============
	- First release - 3/27/2015
	- Export and character names are now remembered
	- Tweaked script for included sample file
	- Fixed issue on saving and loading pose of selection controls
	- Opening or creating a new scene now closes AnimationUI
	- Opening AnimationUI now properly use namespace, if any

	New Bugs:
	- Load pose per selected control doesn't work; always load all controls
Version 2.0
===========
	- Modular
	- Easy to maintain and modify changes / Highly modifiable
	- Input requirements and outputs (i.e., requires result_thigh_lt, creates IK version, output is now ik_thigh_lt)
	- Variables! (headInput, headOutput, armInput, armOutput)
	- Mapping (leftArm_result = result_arm_lt)
	- Y-axis and Z-axis friendly
	- T-pose and A-pose friendly
	- Features! (arm skeleton, arm IK, arm FK, arm IK/FK, arm_elbow) (requirements heavy)
	- Script re-write?
	- Mesh list and mapping (Hair, Head, Body, Clothes, Armor, etc...)
	- Customizable (pre- and post-scripts)

	o Isolate arm/leg settings and elbow_CTRLs
	o Double check if 2nd FREEZE from ik_shoulder_CTRL can be removed
	o Double check if body_CTRL is parent constrained from result_XX_JNT... replace if necessary (weird translation)
	Bug Report:
		somehow FK controls are still vis and IK not showing
	- Proxy version
	- Auto-clean file before saving
		- delete non deform
		- delete undo history
		- 

	- Changing export name doesn't take effect until it lost focus
	- Known issues on Sample File
		- material names
		- 
	- Known Bugs:
		o Stretch doesn't restore leg length 100% when KneeSnap is 1
		o Fix ARM_LT_IKC on A-Pose (can mess up on T-Pose)
		o Fix Copy-Paste keys
			o freeze shoulder_lt/rt
	- Caching system (Saving a Char, Exporting)
	- Saving a character asks a user if he/she wants to immediately load the saved character
	- Delete a character

	- name 123 fails when saving (first character must be a letter)
	- char list is not alphabetically arranged (due to case sensitive)
	- Code clean up:
			- Spaces and TAB count
			- euler worldSpace (worldSpace is not needed - or does it produce the stretch issue? maybe not)
			- (space);
			- (non tab);
			- messageBox / confirmBox from util <- make use of this
			- Remove unnecessary logging
			- Not found object (i.e., on skinning) should return WARN instead)
	- Pose should remember IK / FK settings (posing doesn't restore IK / FK state)
	- Delete hand_end_lt and _04_lt if exists, other than that probably we need to log as WARN
		- is this still needed?
	- Skinning should not fail if it wasn't found, but log as WARN
		- is this still needed?
	- FBX Export aesthetics -> Sort
	- Increase textfield length of counter in Selection Sets and Export Layers
	- Bake Dynamics
		- Implement as necessary or as we get there
	- Blend shapes
	- Reset and Reload should be disabled while on evalDeferred mode or something

NEW SUGGESTIONS:
	- Skeleton mapper
		- Step #1: Add minimal but critical joint markers
		- Step #2: auto-calculate inbetween joints (i.e., for 3 twist joints, calculate diff)

PENDING:
- [low] Shoulder Translation
- Complete all TODOs in rig_script
- rename head_GRP head_neck_GRP
- rename head_FKC to head_GRP
- [low] Head vertices on skinning
	- Pushed back on another model other than the stock (Luka)

What feels good?
- Opening gate that is "Can only be opened from the other side"
- Looting a treasure or corpse. It should feel nice!(Sound? Pics?)


-------------------------------------------------------

I like:
	Vilohg
	Vilohg with traps?
	Vilohg with bomber bombs?
	Vilohg as cute humans?
	Card game mechanics?
	Metal Gear Solid-like (Vision)
	
	Skills:
		Ice
		Fire
		Scorpion's spear

	Survival?


Game Concepts
	Vilohg 2
		Skill costs stamina
		2-player local game
		Fire skill burns opponent which depletes HP overtime
		Ice skill freezes opponent which slightly depletes HP overtime and stuns for 1 sec
		Spear for get-over-here mechanics
		Slam attack which bounces player body and causes shockwave to knockback opponent
		Bomberman bomb-style
		Traps spawns such as:
			Gate trap - block movement
		Leaderboards and scoring system
	Survival
		Hunger games-style
		Multiplayer game
		Game modes such as:
			All out war
			Kill or be killed (Players can change diplomacy against each other anytime (Neutral -> Friendly -> Hostile)
			Single / Co-op in horde mode
		Players depletes HP overtime to prevent camping
		Player can pick up food for HP gain
		Player can pick up a weapon to use
		On near death hunger, player can destroy another player to replenish HP
		Player can see how many food the other player has the more he is hungry
		Metal Gear Solid-like vision (fog of war)
		Torchlight for increased vision in the dark
		Traps can be picked up or triggered
		Traps will only be visible when walking slowly or standing still
		On death, player becomes spectre:
			Spectre can lay traps from another play
			Spectre can slow a player
			Spectre can help a player:
				As an armor to increase defense of a chosen player
			Spectre can possess a horde which strats will be increased and indicator that players can see that an enemy NPC has been possessed (outline color on mesh)
			Spectre can teleport and manipulate the level
		On death V2, can be ressurected as an anemy
		Leaderboards and scoring system
		Player Color:
			Red = Hostile
			Yellow / Gray = Neutral
			Green / Blue = Friend
		Player body parts detached on death
		Ranged Bullet Time as a skill - does not affect everyone
	Survival PVE/PVP
		Same as above except players are neutral to each other at start
		Player can attack another player which makes you evil
		Player can provide or ask items from another player
		Player can still an item from another player:
			Inventory now shows with STOP icon and says "Stolen by player X"
		Has horde mode
		A player can become hard-to-kill "zombie" which everyone wants to destroy
	Get me out of here!
		Single-player game
		Player starts in a dungeon
		Player chooses a door from 3
		Wrong door costs 1 limb
		If player loses a leg, he crawls slow
		If player loses an arm he walks slower while other hand holding the other shoulder that lost its arm
		3 lives, 7 decisions
		Door has clues, probably riddles
		Hunger as time limit as anti-google search
	Torchlight 2-inspired
		Stats! (Strength, Perception, Agility, Intelligence, Charm, Luck)
		RPG Weapons (Long Sword +1) Min. Dmg., Max Dmg
		RPG Armors (Cheat Armor +2) Defense: 30, etc...
		Inventory
		Pick Ups
		Random Map
		Random Enemies
		Level up system
		Torch system
		Day/Night cycle
		
		RPG
	Escape
		Dungeon
		Dark
		Torch
		Enemies
		Level up?
		Randomized "Maze" Level
		Keys
		Locked Doors
		Swords
		Traps
		Sticks
		Weapon (knife, stick)
